## 🎯 Introduction
This Email and document triage chanllenge. This solution is to automate email classification & data extraction using Gen AI models/ LLMs, to improve effeiciency, accuracy & turn around time. While acheving that it also minimize the gate keeping activities. 
   The emails contains diverse requests, oftne with attachments which will be processed to do
   1) Interpret the emails content and attachements.
   2) Identify the intent of the email.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
We have used python, openai.
openai is used for analyze the given emails/ attachements content according to the configured rules, keys, and priorities.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
We faced few challenges
1) OpenAI Python library has changed its interface starting from version 1.0.0. Your code uses the older openai.Completion method, which is no longer supported.
2) Error parsing the sample emails aviable.
3)
